# Global eSIM Country Codes & Reference Data  

Structured reference data (CSV/JSON) for country and mobile network identifiers commonly used in travel connectivity and eSIM contexts.  

## Datasets  

- **ISO country codes** – Standard ISO 3166 codes for each country (see `data/iso-codes.csv`).  
- **Mobile Country Codes (MCC)** – Numeric codes identifying mobile networks and their home countries (see `data/mobile-country-codes.csv`).  
- **Country records** – JSON list of countries with ISO codes and regions (see `data/countries.json`).  
- **eSIM availability indicators** – Simple indicators of whether eSIM is likely available, with notes (see `data/esim-availability.json`).  

## Intended use  

These datasets are designed for travel -tech products, connectivity platforms and developers working with international mobile data. They provide a starting point for building services such as country lookups, carrier matching and eSIM eligibility checks.  

## Reference  

Data structure is inspired by real -world eSIM platforms such as [Simcardo: Global Travel eSIM & Mobile Data Plans](https://simcardo.com).
